# C964 - Computer Science Capstone


The project topic will be focused on stock prices. The goal is to create an interactive web app to display information and create a price forecast on a stock selected by the user. This project will be using an AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) approach to forecasting. This model was chosen as it is useful to use when forecasting time-series data, such as stock prices. Final product will be a web application that allows the user to view stock data and then create a 30-day price forecast.
